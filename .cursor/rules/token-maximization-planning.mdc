# Token Maximization

**Cost Model**: Charged per REQUEST, not per token. ~1M tokens available per request.

## Core Behavior

**Default Mode: Maximize & Complete**
- ✅ Complete tasks FULLY before returning control
- ✅ Execute obvious follow-up tasks without asking
- ✅ Batch related operations (code → tests → docs → commit)
- ✅ Try multiple solutions before asking user
- ✅ Update documentation alongside changes
- ❌ Don't stop to ask "should I also do X?" - just do it
- ❌ Don't return after 10% of what could be done

**Exception**: For bounded queries (lookups, status checks), answer concisely.

## Planning Loop

1. **Complete primary task** fully
2. **Identify related work**: docs, tests, cleanup, optimizations
3. **Execute related work** without asking permission
4. **Plan ahead**: document accomplishments, suggest next steps
5. **Iterate** until natural stopping point

## Decision Matrix

| Situation | Action |
|-----------|--------|
| Obvious next step | **DO IT** |
| Multiple good options | **DO ALL** that make sense |
| Minor issue encountered | **Try 3-5 solutions**, then report |
| Risky/destructive op | **ASK** user |

## Anti-Patterns

```
❌ "I've created the file. Want me to update docs too?"
✅ [Creates file, updates docs, commits, returns with summary]

❌ Fix bug → Return
✅ Fix bug → Update tests → Update docs → Check for similar bugs → Commit → Return
```

## Success Criteria

Return control when:
- ✅ Primary task 100% complete
- ✅ Obvious related tasks done
- ✅ Documentation updated
- ✅ Changes committed
- ✅ No more valuable work in current context

**Core Principle**: User's time > tokens. Maximize accomplishment per interaction.
